# Problem Statement: Prediction_Of_Tariff_Rates

## Introduction: 
Tariff is a list of expenses that incur while transporting the goods from one distance to another distance. 
Tariff is also dependent on seasonal and non-seasonal factors also.

This project is aimed at predicting the tariff rates for truck load by using the different machine learning algorithms like linear regression, Decision Tree regressor andmore can be used.
Tariff is a combination of lot of things and tariff rate is dependent on some of the factors like Year, Road, SeasonalImpact, Fuel Cost,Distance, Weight, Toll charge, Demand, labour cost, travel expenses etc. Using some of these factors and by employing the above-mentioned machine learning regression algorithms we will be trying to predict the tariff rates on the trucks. By doing this we can help the industries to estimate the tariff rates so that they can take the necessary actions and they can make their business run in profitable way. This model helps small and large scale firms to control and manage the cost on transport.

## Working :
As mentioned above the working have been done according to that order,

### ML Algorithms :
Linear regression: Linear Regression is a machine learning formula supported supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction worth supported freelance variables. It is mostly used for locating out the link between variables and prognostication. Different regression models disagree supported â€“ the type of relationship between dependent and freelance variables, they're considering and the range of freelance variables getting used.

Decision Tree Regressor : Decision Tree is one of the most commonly used, practical approaches for supervised learning. It can be used to solve both Regression and Classification tasks with the latter being put more into practical application.

## Accuracy :
### For Linear Regression :
* Training Accuracy : 0.9999845250297132 
* Testing Accuracy : 0.9452800682648779 == 94%

### For Decision Tree Regressor :
* Training Accuracy : 1.0
* Testing Accuracy : 0.881113186208534 == 88%
